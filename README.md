# CoDE-4 Cosmology Engine

## Computational Dark-Energy Framework for Cross-Epoch Cosmological Consistency

---

# Overview

**CoDE-4** (Cosmological Dark-Energy Engine v4) is an exploratory computational cosmology framework designed to investigate whether mild late-time modifications to cosmic expansion can remain approximately consistent with multiple observational probes while reducing the inferred Hubble tension.

The project focuses on:

* late-time expansion dynamics,
* cosmic growth evolution,
* geometric consistency tests,
* large-scale structure behavior,
* and cross-epoch observational comparisons.

Rather than proposing a fully fundamental theory of gravity, CoDE-4 currently operates as a phenomenological proof-of-concept framework intended for computational experimentation and cosmological analysis.

The framework numerically evaluates:

* expansion history,
* structure growth,
* acoustic scales,
* weak-lensing parameters,
* supernova distances,
* BAO scales,
* matter-radiation equality,
* and Integrated Sachs-Wolfe behavior.

# Scientific Motivation

Modern cosmology faces several observational tensions between early-universe and late-universe measurements.

Most notably:

## Hubble Tension

Measurements from:

* the Planck CMB inference pipeline suggest

H_0\approx67.4\ \mathrm{km\ s^{-1}\ Mpc^{-1}}

while local distance-ladder observations (SH0ES) suggest

H_0\approx73\ \mathrm{km\ s^{-1}\ Mpc^{-1}}

creating a discrepancy approaching:

\sim5\sigma

CoDE-4 explores whether a mild redshift-dependent modification to dark-energy scaling can alter late-time expansion while preserving approximate consistency with:

* CMB geometry,
* acoustic scales,
* structure growth,
* and distance observables.

# Core Model

The framework modifies the effective dark-energy contribution using the phenomenological scaling function:

C(z)=1+\epsilon\left(\frac{z}{(1+z)^2}\right)\left(1-\frac{0.15}{1+z}\right)

where:

* ( \epsilon ) controls modification strength,
* the correction decays naturally at both early and late times,
* and the model remains close to standard ΛCDM at high redshift.

The modified expansion history becomes:

H(z)=H_0\sqrt{\Omega_m(1+z)^3+\Omega_r(1+z)^4+\Omega_{DE}C(z)}

This allows the framework to explore small departures from ΛCDM while preserving approximate early-universe consistency.

# Scientific Interpretation

CoDE-4 should currently be interpreted as:

* and a proof-of-concept late-time modification study.

The purpose of the project is to investigate whether mild expansion-history modifications can simultaneously preserve approximate observational consistency across multiple cosmological sectors.
